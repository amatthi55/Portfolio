The exact location of the crimes were not given for privacy reasons but the data set does provide coordinates that reflect the nearest 100 block.

    "There is some evidence of a relationship between clusters of liquor stores and clusters of assaults in Los Angeles. The clusters in the north central part of the city and the north east part of the city cover the same area. Also, that empty patch centered at (33.4, -118.375), the Beverly Hills area, has no centriods in it. At the same time, many of the crime centriods are not near the store centroids. I would say there may be a connection between liquor store and assault crime location but there a lot more analysis to do. For example, it would be interesting to sea how clusters of assaults compare with clusters of population in the city. If it turned out assualt centroids were closer to liquor store centriods than population centriods, that would indicate that liquor store density is more predictive of crime density than population densisty is."
