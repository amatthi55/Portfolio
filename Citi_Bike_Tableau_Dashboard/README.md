## Citi Bike Data

Click [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/alex.matthiessen#!/vizhome/Citi_Bike_HW/Dashboard1) to view my Tableau dashboard of Citi Bike data from the last three months. View the dashboard in full screen for the best data exploration experience.

### Data

The data set for this dashboard is taken from https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html, a webpage that Citi Bike maintains to publish its bike trip data.

Some interesting observations:

-Between midnight and 4:00am the most popular stations are in the lower west part of Manhattan. In the middle of the day the most popular stations are in Midtown Manhattan and in the late afternoon the east side of Manhattan becomes the most active area.

-Between midnight and 7:00am the ratio of subscriber rides to customer rides increases sharply. Customers are those who pay Citi Bike a fee per trip and subscribers pay Citi Bike a subscription fee.
